# AI_Chat_Widget
Have you ever spent hours researching the specifics of a random product that you needed to buy, comparing the endless list of options that you have available to you for you to only give up? We found current solutions to this issue like LiveChat to be incomplete, lacking accessibility, personalization, and general helpfulness. Our team identified these issues and, as a response, decided to create a solution: an innovative widget that can be added to any sales website, web scraping data from the site to assist users in finding the perfect product for them, employing Generative AI, providing an accessible interface, utilizing proompting, and offering live voice calls with a professional.
